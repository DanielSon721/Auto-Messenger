This is the SigPhi Auto Messenger made by Daniel Son, written in Python! As treasurer of my fraternity, I was getting sick of copy and pasting messages regarding financial obligations to dozens of people, so I made this project.

The purpose of this script is to automate the process of sending blast texts, fine notices for missing chapter, and other miscellaneous reminders.

This program uses Google Sheets API to access two google spreadsheets: the first containing members' contact information and the second containing members' attendance history.

This program also utilizes Textbelt API to send SMS messages. Textbelt handles carrier routing, compliance, and formatting. Unfortunately, sending SMS messages costs money. Fortunately, sending SMS messages is very cheap! I purchased 700 messages for $10 for this project.
